## What I Am Working On
### 1. Monolith to Microservices Migration (AWS EKS + Azure AKS)

Real-world companies are migrating from legacy monoliths to Kubernetes. Multi-cloud is hot.

What this project includes:
	•	Side-by-side comparison of monolith vs. microservices
	•	Helm charts, ArgoCD/GitHub Actions, Terraform
	•	Observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

**GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/Here2ServeU/monolith-to-microservices-t2s.git
⸻

### 2. CI/CD Template Generator (DevOps SaaS for Teams)

Developer Experience (DevX) is exploding. Teams want automation, fast.

What the project includes:
	•	Dynamic form/UI to generate GitHub Actions, Terraform, K8s templates
	•	Support for security scanning (Trivy, Snyk), notifications (Slack/Teams), and environments (dev/stage/prod)
	•	Stripe integration for paid features

**GitHub Repo**: Already building → ci-cd-template-builder (private) 

⸻

### 3. AI-Powered SRE Template Generator

AI + SRE is a powerful combo. SRE is essential for mature DevOps orgs.

What the project includes:
	•	Generate SLOs, postmortems, chaos experiments
	•	Use OpenAI API to draft markdown templates
	•	Deploy backend on EKS with frontend on Vercel

**GitHub Repo**: Already started but not accessible for everyone yet

### 4. Multi-Tenant SaaS Boilerplate (Micro-SaaS DevOps Platform)

SaaS devs are looking for infra-ready starter kits

What the project includes:
	•	Subdomain-per-tenant, RBAC, Stripe, JWT auth
	•	Terraform modules for AWS/GCP deployment
	•	Helm charts for rapid launch

**GitHub Repo**: In progress → multi-tenant-saas

### 5. Cloud Cost Optimization Dashboard (FinOps + DevOps)

Every organization wants to reduce cloud waste

What this project includes:
	•	Terraform + Infracost integration
	•	Dashboard using React + AWS Cost Explorer APIs
