# Hi, I’m Emmanuel Naweji.

### Bridging the Gap Between AI Research & Cloud Reliability.
**Ph.D. Candidate (AI/ML) | Cloud & DevOps Solutions Architect | Site Reliability Engineer**

---

I build autonomous, **self-healing infrastructure** that guarantees **99.999% availability**.

As a **Ph.D. Candidate** specializing in **AI/ML for Healthcare**, I bring **over 10 years of experience** designing, securing, and scaling cloud infrastructure. My background includes engineering resilience for major enterprises like **IBM, Comcast, and Octo**, blending academic rigor with practical automation.

My work integrates **predictive AI** with **deterministic GitOps** to help highly regulated businesses (Healthcare, Finance) move faster while meeting the highest standards of governance and security (HIPAA, SOC 2, FedRAMP).
